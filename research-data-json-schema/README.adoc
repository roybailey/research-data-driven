= JSon schema domain code generation

== Motivation

Look at using json schema definition to code generate Java Data Transfer Objects.
Idea would be to define domain schema via json schema, so Java backend services could
build to contract and JavaScript front end can validate the same.


== Getting Started

* See schema definition under `src/main/resources/schema`
* See generated code under package `me.roybailey.data.schema`
* See code generation steps in maven build


== Included in the Box

* JSon schema for User, Product, Order objects
* Simple code generation using http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/[Json Schema Code Generator]
* Enrichment of generated objects to include Lombok builders and LocalDateTime
